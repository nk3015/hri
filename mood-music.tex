Scenario: Cozmo can identify the user’s mood and play music to suit it.

Tasks:
Cozmo can detect a user's emotional state via facial expressions (e.g., happiness, sadness) using a facial recognition API or mood-sensing APIs like Affectiva.
Based on the detected mood, Cozmo can play a song from a connected music service (Spotify API or YouTube Music API).
Reaction: Cozmo dances and reacts to the music genre (e.g., head bobbing for a happy song, sad movements for a slow ballad).
